# Asset-allocation-Models

The scope of this project was to deepen the main asset allocation techniques and discuss their differences, with a focus on the implementation of them.
This task was assigned as a take-home exam, so something could have been made just for didactics.
However, it was important to build up strong Python's knowledge and better understand the pros and cons of these methodologies.

The whole job was carried out together with my colleague and friend Simone.
